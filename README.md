# ai-Learn
Ailean is a web platform for immigrant parents seeking to improve their English language skills through situational conversational modules to improve their job marketability and day to day situations. The United States of America currently houses a large population of immigrants who struggle with learning the English language. These individuals do not get the opportunity of upward social mobility, and are often discriminated against in the workforce. As a result of improving their English language proficiency, parents will provide greater educational and economical support for their children.
